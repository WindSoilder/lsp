Language Server Protocol implementation.  Which is highly inspired by
[Sans-IO Pattern](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html).

So the actual language server can build on this, it can be integreted with
trio, asyncio, or some server else.

WARNING: It's under development and not complete for now.


* Required python version
Python >= 3.6
